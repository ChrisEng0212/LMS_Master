        "Description": "Instant noodles are fast, convenient and delicious, and are the best option for many people to satisfy their hunger. Why are the noodles curved? In fact, it\u2019s because the curved noodles can create larger gaps. Increase the contact space of hot water on average so that the noodles can be evenly heated. This way the instant noodles can be cooked faster. If the space between the noodles is too small, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s easier to cook.",

        "Comments": "No matter how delicious it is, most instant noodles still have health concerns that are high in oil and salty. How to eat instant noodles healthier and more delicious? Heat the water first, let the instant noodles soak, then there will be oil floating out, pour out the water when the noodles are not very soft. Reheat the water and add the seasoning bag at the same time, but not all. Pick out the dried vegetables and add it to the instant noodles. This can reduce the intake of oil, salt and sugar.  (Final point... something about being health in this time when everyone is buying all the noodle to eat at home.....????)",

But in the end he finished the performance with ease.  And there are so many people in the audience, because I also learned acting in high school, so I know that it\u2019s  a totally different feeling offstage compared with onstage , Even if you practice one hundred times off the stage, you may still make mistakes on stage , So it's remarkable that he can face so many people without doing something wrong.

His facial expression is so cute. Obviously, his parents want to make their baby happy, so they keep ripping papers and record their baby's reaction.",

Because when the baby is laughing, he is staring at the paper, but I have no idea that his laughing is because of the acting or the sound; therefore, I wonder what sounds make people laugh or scared?

But for me, I saw the relationship between human and animal. As long as you spend time with the animals, take care of them, and love them, even without language they still can understand. They can use body language to know when they are happy,sad,mad,excited and so on. Even some animals can imitate humans to speak. So what we can learn from this video is that even animals can understand what humans say , as long as you stay with them and love them.",

If we won\u2019t talk to people like this when we are in person, then why do we leave these comments on the internet to others? I think it is very odd and we should think more about how our comments will make people feel before we leave them, after all, internet bullying is a serious problem in modern society.",

As we can see, the African in the video found person's name and address, which means our information, such as name, IP, address, phone number are not as safe as we thought. Whatever the internet or the real-life, we should all treat people well.",
